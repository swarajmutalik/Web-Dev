# CSS Filters

- CSS filters are a powerful tool that allows web developers to apply visual effects to HTML elements, such as images, videos, and text.

- Filters can adjust color, blur, contrast, brightness, and more, enabling the creation of stunning effects with minimal effort.

- `blur(radius)`

  - Applies a Gaussian blur to the element.

- `brightness(amount)`

  - Adjusts the brightness of the element.

  - The value is a number where 1 is the original brightness, less than 1 darkens, and greater than 1 brightens.

- `contrast(amount)`

  - Adjusts the contrast of the element.

  - Values: 1 (default), less than 1 decreases contrast, greater than 1 increases contrast.

- `grayscale(amount)`

  - Converts the element to grayscale.

  - Values: 0 (original colors) to 1 (fully grayscale).

- `hue-rotate(angle)`

  - Rotates the hue of the element's colors around the color wheel.

  - The value is in degrees (e.g., 0deg, 90deg).

- `invert(amount)`

  - Inverts the colors of the element.

  - Values: 0 (no inversion) to 1 (full inversion).

- `opacity(amount)`

  - Adjusts the transparency of the element.

  - Values: 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).

  - Adjusts the color saturation.

  - Values: 1 (default), less than 1 desaturates, greater than 1 oversaturates.
