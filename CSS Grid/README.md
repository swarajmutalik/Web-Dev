# CSS Grid

- CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in CSS that allows developers to create complex and responsive web layouts efficiently.

- CSS Grid is a 2-dimensional layout system, meaning it can handle both rows and columns, unlike Flexbox, which is primarily 1-dimensional. It is especially useful for creating structured, grid-based designs.

- Some key concepts and terminologies that are of importance are as follows -

  - `Grid Container` - The parent element that holds the grid items. It is defined using display: grid or display: inline-grid.

  - `Grid Items` - The direct children of the grid container, which are positioned within the grid.

  - `Grid Lines` - The dividing lines that create rows and columns.

  - `Grid Tracks` - The space between two grid lines, representing rows or columns.

  - `Grid Cells` - The smallest unit in a grid where a row and column intersect.

  - `Grid Areas` - A rectangular space in the grid that can span multiple rows and columns.

- Some of the grid properties are as follows -

  - `grid-template-rows`: Specifies the height of grid rows.

  - `grid-template-columns`: Specifies the width of grid columns.

  - `grid-template-areas`: Names grid areas for easier layout control.

  - `grid-row`: Specifies the starting and ending row for an item.

  - `grid-column`: Specifies the starting and ending column for an item.

  - `grid-area`: Places an item into a specific named grid area.

  - `row-gap`: Space between rows.

  - `column-gap`: Space between columns.

  - `gap`: Shorthand for both row and column gaps.

  - `grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns`: Define sizes for rows/columns added implicitly.

  - `grid-auto-flow`: Controls the placement of items, e.g., row, column, or dense.
