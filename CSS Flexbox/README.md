# CSS Flexbox

- The CSS Flexbox is a layout model designed to help distribute space within a container more efficiently and align items in a flexible way, even if their sizes are dynamic or unknown

- Some of the key properties that are being followed are as follows -

  - `Flex Container`: The parent element where the flexbox layout is applied. Defined by setting the display property to `flex` or `inline-flex`

  - `Flex-direction`: Defines the direction of the main axis (the direction in which items are placed).

  - `justify-content`: Aligns items along the main axis.

  - `align-items`: Aligns items along the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis).

  - `align-content`: Aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines (only applies when there are multiple lines, like in a wrap scenario).

  - `flex-wrap`: Controls whether items should wrap onto multiple lines.

  - `gap`: Adds space between items.

  - `order`: Specifies the order of the items.

  - `flex-grow`: Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest.

  - `flex-shrink`: Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest.

  - `align-self`: Overrides the align-items property for a specific flex item
