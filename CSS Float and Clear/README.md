# CSS Float and Clear

- The float property in CSS is used to position elements to the left or right of their container, allowing text or other inline elements to wrap around it.

- Values of float are as follows -

  - `left`: The element is floated to the left of its container.

  - `right`: The element is floated to the right of its container.

- The clear property is used to control the behavior of elements following floated elements. It ensures that elements do not wrap around floats and instead start below them.

- Values of clear are as follows -

  - `left`: No floating elements are allowed on the left side of the element.

  - `right`: No floating elements are allowed on the right side of the element.

  - `both`: No floating elements are allowed on either side of the element.
