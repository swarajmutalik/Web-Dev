# JS Conditionals

- JavaScript conditionals are a fundamental concept used to execute code based on certain conditions. They allow developers to control the flow of a program depending on whether a given condition is true or false.

- `if Statement` -

  - The if statement executes a block of code only if the specified condition evaluates to true.

- `if...else Statement` -

  - The if...else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition evaluates to false.

- `if...else if...else Statement`

  - This structure allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.

- `Ternary Operator`

  - The ternary operator provides a shorthand for if...else.

  - `condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;`

- Logical Operators in Conditionals

  - You can combine conditions using logical operators like && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT).
