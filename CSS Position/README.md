# CSS Positions

- It is a property in CSS that is used to determine how an element is position in the document.

- `static` - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

- `relative` - The element is positioned relative to its original position in the normal flow.

- `absolute` - The element is removed from the document flow and is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or the html element if no ancestor is positioned.

- `fixed` - The element is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to the viewport.

- `sticky` - The element toggles between `relative` and `fixed`, depending on the user's scrol position.
