# CSS Display Property

- It is a powerful and fundamental tool that is used for controlling the layout of HTML elements of a webpage.

- It determines how elements are displayed in the document, affecting their overall layout,alignment and stacking.

- The main values of `display` property are as follows -

  - `block` - This value makes an element a block-level element

  - `inline` - These elements only take up as much width as necessary and dont start on a new line.

  - `inline-block` - It is similar to inline elements but can have a speicified width and height.

  - `none` - It hides the element completely, removing it from the document flow.
