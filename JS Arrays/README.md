# Arrays in JS

- An array is a special type of object that is used to store multiple values in a single variable.

- Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.

- Some of the array methods are as follows -

  - `push()` - It is used to add a element at the end.

  - `pop()` - It is used to remove the last element.

  - `unshift()` - It is used to add an element at the beginning.

  - `shift()` - It is used to remove the first element.

  - `indexOf(value)` - It is used to retrun index of the value.

  - `includes(value)` - It returns `true` if the value is found.

  - `find()` - It is used to return the first match.

  - `reverse()` - It is used to reverse the array.

  - `concat()` - It is used to combine the arrays.

  - `slice(start,end)` - It is used to extract a part of an array.

  - `splice(start, deletecount)` - It is used to modify the array.

  - `map()` - It is a method that creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.

  - `filter()` - It is a method that is used to create a new array containing only elements that meet a certain condition.

  - `reduce()` - It is a method that reduces an array to a single value.
