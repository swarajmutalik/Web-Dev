# Block Vs Inline Elements 

## Block Element 

Block-level elements are designed to occupy the full width available in their parent container. Each block-level element starts on a new line and takes up the full width, pushing any following content onto the next line by default.

## Inline Element

Inline elements, in contrast, only take up as much width as necessary to contain their content. They do not start on a new line and allow other elements to sit alongside them horizontally.
