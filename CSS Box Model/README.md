# CSS Box Model

CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that defines how the elements are displayed on a webpage.

It consists of the following 4 parts : -

1. Content

    - It is the innermost area where the text, images or other content is displayed.

    - The `Width` and `Height` properties define the size of the content box.

2. Padding

    - It is the space between the content and the border.

    - Padding adds extra space inside the element, thereby increasing the element's size.

3. Border

    - It surrounds the padding and the content.

4. Margin

    - The outermost area that separates the element from other elements.

    - Margin can be set to create space around elements, preventing them from touching each other.

## Box Model Properties

- `Box Sizing` - It defines how the width and height are calculated.

- `content-box` - Default; width/height include only the content box.

- `border-box`: Width/height include content, padding, and border.
