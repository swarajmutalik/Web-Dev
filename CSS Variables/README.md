# CSS Variables

- CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow developers to define reusable values that can be referenced throughout the CSS file.

- CSS variables are defined using the `--` prefix and are accessible through the `var()` function.

- Some of the advantages of the CSS Variables are as follows -

  - `Reusability`: Centralize styles to avoid repetition.

  - `Dynamic Updates`: Variables can be updated dynamically using JavaScript or based on CSS selectors.

  - `Scoped Styling`: Variables can be scoped to specific elements for more precise control.

- There are two types of scopes in CSS variables and they are as follows -

  - `Global Variables`: Defined in `:root` and accessible throughout the document.

  - `Local Variables`: Defined within specific selectors and available only within that scope.
