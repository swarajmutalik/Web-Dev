<h1>Website Workflow</h1>

<p>Websites work by allowing the users to access and interact with the content over the internet.</p>

1. User Request - 
- A user types a website URL into a web browser or clicks a link.

- The browser sends the request to the DNS to translate the domain name into an IP address.

2. Server Response -
- Once the IP address is identified, the browser sends a request to the corresponding web server.

- The server receives the request and processes it, checking which resources are required.

3. Data Processing(Backend) - 
-  The server interacts with the databases or APIs to retrieve the necessary data.

- Any dynamic content is generated using the backend programming languages.

4. Rendering the Page(Frontend) - 
- The server sends back the requested files.

- The browser starts rendering the page based on the HTML structure.

    - HTML defines the structure and the content.

    - CSS adds styles such as color and fonts.

    - JavaScript provides interactivity.

5. Display and User Interaction - 

- The browser displays the webpage to the user.

- Users can interact with the pages by clicking buttons, navigating between the pages.

6. Response Loop - 

- If the user performs an action, the browser sends a new request to the server and the process repeats.

- The server sends the updated content back, which the browser renders again.
