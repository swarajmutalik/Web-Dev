# CSS Shadows

- CSS shadows are a powerful styling feature used to create depth, emphasis, and visual effects in web design.

- With CSS, you can apply shadows to both text and elements, adding a layer of dimension and helping to highlight specific parts of a page.

- `box-shadow` - It is a property that applies shadow to elements like divs, images and buttons. It has several parameters that allow you to control the shadow's position, size, blur, spread and color.

- `text-shadow` - It is a property that is used to add shadows to the text, this can create a 3D effect or highlight important text sections.
