# CSS Sizing Units

- CSS Sizing Units are fundamental to controlling the dimensions and spacing of elements on a webpage.

- They are classified into relative and absolute units.

  - Absolute Units define the fixed sizes that don't change based on screen size or parent elements.

  - Some common examples of aboslute units are as follows -

    - pixels - It is the most common unit representing a fixed number of pixels.

    - inches - It is primarily used for print style rather than web design.

  - Relative Units adapt based on their context, making them ideal for responsive design, where sizes need to be adjusted with screen dimensions.

  - Some of the most common types used in these are as follows -

    - em - It is relative to the font-size of the parent element.

    - rem - It is relative to the font-size of the root element.

    - vw(Viewport Width) and vh(Viewport Height) - It is relative to the viewport size.

    - vmin and vmax - It is relative to the smallest or largest dimension of the viewport.
