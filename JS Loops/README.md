# JS Loops

- Loops in JavaScript are powerful tools that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, making your code more efficient and concise.

- They are essential for tasks like iterating through arrays, performing repetitive operations, and automating processes.

## Types of Loops

1.  For Loop

    - The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance.

    - Syntax:

            for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // Code to be executed
            }

2.  While Loop

    - The while loop continues to execute as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.

    - Syntax:

            while (condition) {
                // Code to be executed
            }

3.  Do-While Loop

    - Similar to the while loop, but ensures the code block executes at least once before checking the condition.

    - Syntax:

            do {
            // Code to be executed
            } while (condition);

4.  For...of Loop

    - The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, or other collection types.

    - Syntax:

            for (const element of iterable) {
            // Code to be executed
            }

5.  For...in Loop

    - The for...in loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object.

    - Syntax:

            for (const key in object) {
            // Code to be executed
            }
