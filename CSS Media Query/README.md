# CSS Media Queries

- CSS Media Queries enable responsive web design by applying styles based on specific conditions such as screen size, resolution, orientation, or other device characteristics.

- Some of the common conditions that are used in CSS Media Queries are as follows -

  - `min-width`: Applies styles if the viewport is at least the specified width.

  - `max-width`: Applies styles if the viewport is no larger than the specified width.

  - `orientation`: landscape: For devices in landscape mode.

  - `orientation`: portrait: For devices in portrait mode.

  - `min-resolution` and `max-resolution`: Define styles based on screen resolution.
