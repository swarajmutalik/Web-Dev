# Basics of JS

- Variables in JavaScript are containers used to store data values.

- They play a fundamental role in programming by allowing developers to save, update, and retrieve data efficiently.

- In JavaScript, you can declare variables using three keywords: var, let, and const

  - `var`

    - Scope: Function-scoped.
    - Usage: Used to declare variables globally or within a function.

  - `let`

    - Scope: Block-scoped.
    - Usage: Allows you to declare variables with restricted scope and prevents re-declaration.

  - `const`
    - Scope: Block-scoped.
    - Usage: Used for variables that should not be reassigned. However, objects and arrays declared with const can be modified.

- In JavaScript, data types represent the different kinds of values that can be used and manipulated in a program.

- JavaScript data types can be broadly categorized into:

  1. Primitive Data Types (Immutable, stored by value)

  2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Mutable, stored by reference)

- Primitive data types are the simplest and most basic forms of data. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created.

1. String

   - Represents textual data.

   - Enclosed in single ('), double ("), or backticks (`) for template literals.

2. Number

   - Represents numeric values (integers and floating-point numbers).

3. Boolean

   - Represents logical values: true or false.

4. Undefined

   - Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

5. Null

    - Represents an intentional absence of any value.

- Non-primitive data types are objects and can hold multiple values.

1. Object

    - Represents collections of key-value pairs.

2. Array

    - Represents a list of values (ordered collection).
