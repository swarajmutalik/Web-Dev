# Semantic Tags in HTML

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaning to the content within them, beyond just its appearance or formatting. These tags help browsers, developers, and search engines understand the structure and content of a webpage more accurately, which improves accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

Some of the reasons for using Semantic Tags are as follows -

- SEO(Search Engine Optimization) - Semantic Tags allows search engines to understand the content's context, making it easier to index and rank pages.

- Maintainability - Well structured semantic HTML makes code easier to read, manage and debug which is beneficial for teams that are working on large projects.

Some of the common semantic tags that are used are as follows -

- header - Defines introductory content or a set of navigational links. Typically, a header section contains logos, headings, and main navigation links.

- nav - Specifies a section containing navigation links, like the main site menu or secondary navigation.

- article - Represents a standalone piece of content that could be independently distributed or repurposed (e.g., blog posts, news articles).

- section - Groups related content, generally with its own heading. For instance, a page might have sections for different topics or categories.

- aside - Contains content indirectly related to the main content, like sidebars, advertisements, or additional notes.

- footer - Defines the footer for a document or section, usually containing copyright information, contact details, or links.

- figure and figcaption - Used for images, illustrations, diagrams, etc., with <figcaption> providing a caption or description.
