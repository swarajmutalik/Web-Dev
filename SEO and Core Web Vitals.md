# SEO and Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are the essential metrics that are defined by Google to measure a webpage's user experience quality, focusing on aspects of loading, interactivity.

Optmizing these can help improve a site's SEO performance, as they are some key ranking signals in Google's algorithm.

1. LCP(Largest Contentful Paint)

- It measures loading performance by capturing how quickly the largest element becomes visible within the viewport.

- Ideally LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first begins loading.

2. FID(First Input Delay)

- It measures interactivity, specifically the time it takes from when a user first interacts with a page to when the browser can begin processing that interaction.

- FID should be less than 100 milliseconds.

3. CLS( Cummulative Layout Shift)

- It is for measuring the visual stability by tracking unexpected layout shifts during the page's load. 

- A CLS score of less than 0.1 is ideal.
